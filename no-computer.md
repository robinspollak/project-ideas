# No computer project
Math problem sets as a DSL

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.



### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_
The need is for communication between teachers and students about what work needs to be done in order to succeed in the class. Problem sets help both teachers and students in quantitative courses by providing them with means to enumerate what tasks need to be done for homework and how they should be done. Without problem sets math students would be left trying to find good problems to help them learn the material while professors would be forced to deal with students that were all doing different work. With problem sets it helps professors and graders be of more help to the students as well because they can be very familiar with the problems that students are doing and therefore be able to provide tips without giving away the answer or disallowing the students from learning.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A language meets their needs because it allows the professor to tell all of his students exactly what to do, have them understand exactly what needs to be done, and do it in a specific way that is understandable to the professor, grader, and other students.



### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
It excites me because I do matjh problem sets almost every day and dont know how i would learn the material without them. Also, without problem sets I wouldnt be able to get specific help so it is really relevant to me. I came up with it when I was using latex to write a problem set.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Students and professors of quantitatives.


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 
The user in this case is the professor who writes the program (the PS) that is then executed by the computer (the student). Programming looks like making up problems or selecting them from a problem book and assigning them to the students. If you dont do it in this way, you really arent using the language at all!

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_
When a program runs a student does the problems in the program and explains how he did them. A program interacts with the user by being graded and errors might occur if the student misunderstood the problem, made a computational answer, could not solve the problem, or was lazy. This is communicated in the output of the program but is not overtly identified as an error. Bad error messages in this lanugage!!


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
It should be easy to regulate the work that students are doing, it would be possible to make qualitative homework assignments using this language but not as easy and it would be seriously impossible to try and do anything non-homework-related in this language.


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_
I dont think there are any other DSLs in this domain.


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
I feel like this question isnt very applicable, but it would be almost exclusively language design decisions.


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_
Not a very big idea, not a very good project idea as there isnt really anything to build.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
Bad idea because it isnt really buildable and there is no computer involved.
