# No computer project 2
Legislation

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.



### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_
The need is to have a uniform way of writing laws. Without a system in place a persons experience would be scattered and difficult to understand and complex. The experience with a regulated system is much better.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A DSL is appropriate because we need to write laws in language but without guidelines the above problems would run rampant, with regulation these problems are mitigated.


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
This idea is cool because its necessary, but I actually think that this system is pretty archiac and difficult for the layman to understand. I came up with this idea when I was reading some legislation for my politics class.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Old white dudes writing laws.


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 
The user interacts with the language by under a series of declaratives, some of which are required and unique, some of which are required* and some of which are optional. A program looks like a series of text with bolded headers starting with the sponsors of a bill, the name, the enacting clause, the substance (in a series of WHEREAS subheaders), the repealing clause (which repeals all laws conflicting), and the effective date. 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_
When a program runs the content of the program becomes the law of the land, enforceable by police. Errors can occur in spelling, or content (bad laws) and they are communicated to the user by the executive and judicial branches or by the people.


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
It _should_ be easy to write laws but its actually not very easy because of the archaic syntax. It would be possible to write non-laws in this format but difficult, and its impossible to do pretty much anything else.


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_
There are no other DSLs which seems crazy! Someone should definitely change that. If it was easier to understand maybe some law makers would actually _read_ legislation instead of having their workers do it for them.


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
If someone were to work on redesigining this system it would be all language design decisions.


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_
Big and ambitious, but not really applicable to this class.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
Bad idea because its not a computer project and it would be really hard to get a new system adopted.
