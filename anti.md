# Anti project
Limiting Social Media Use

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.



### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_
The project would serve those that feel that social media is distracting and they spend too much time doing it, but still worry about missing out on important things that happen. These people often feel pressured to be checking social media (even subconcious pressure) when they want to be more engaged with the present. With this their experience could be less distracted.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A language might be a good way to do this because they could query all of their social media for important updates and get them all back at once without worry about checking stuff throughout the day. But actually, a language is a bad solution because there is really only _one function_ and that could just be a button press so an app might be a better solution.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
I also feel this way! I hate feeling attached to my phone, and I came up with it both through personal experience and also through many conversations with people.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
People that feel SM distracts.


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 
Here is the meat of why this is not a good fit for a language. The only thing needed for this is configuration (which social media, setting up with your accounts) and execution (basically a click to query all of the SM). A language is better suited for something that would have multiple functions but with a similar syntax.


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_
When a program runs all of the chosen SM outlets would be scraped and a digest would be returned to the user letting them know if there is stuff that they missed or should check out. Errors would not really be able to occur, another reason that this is a bad choice for a language.


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
It should be easy to query your social media but that is the only thing it should and would be able to do.


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_
There are a lot of similar things but only in one social media domain, some scrape twitter or facebook or news outlets but nothing that I could find does all of them.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
It would almost all be systems, making it a bad project/DSL

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_
pretty big idea, as you would have to interact with many different outlets


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
This is a bad idea for a project because a language is the wrong solution for this problem.
