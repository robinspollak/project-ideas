# Free project 1
A natural language processor for creating calendar events

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_
The need is to be able to create calendar events by just typing in information as you would tell it to a peer. (eg. "i have a doctors appointment at 415 pm this thursday at student health services") Without this a person would have to fill in all those fields (what, when, where) individually. If i could help them, talking to a computer would be just as easy as talking to a human.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A language because humans like to talk in languages that are easy to understand and english is at the top of that list for my potential users. 

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
Im excited about this idea because I want to use it! I came up with it when I was talking to Siri and doing this, but I dont think that there is a written equivalent baked into OSX.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
People that use computer calendars.


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 
The user will interact with the language by writing in english, programming looks like plain english, and this is the right way to do it because thats the whole point! 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_
When a program runs it will create and save an event in your calendar with the specified parameters, a program would interact with a user by saving the event and potentially giving popup messages to the user if there is an error. There might be an error if the parser misunderstands the text.


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
It would be really easy to make calendar events but impossible to do anything else.


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_
I dont think there any other DSLs in this domain, but I definitely could be wrong. I looked a fair amount on google and couldnt find anything but I also couldnt think of a really good search to do. It seems obvious that there should be this, so I dont know why there isnt (if in fact there isnt)


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
I think it would be a little more system aspects because I would have to figure out what words mean what and in what contexts while the english is pretty standardized already.


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_
I think this is a medium sized project. It would be pretty ambitious and one thing I would be worried about would be integration with a computers calendar, but I think it is doable.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
I think this is a good idea because it sounds really cool, fun and interesting but it might be a bad idea because, as ive been doing this, Ive realized that its only kind of a DSL. The language here is english and the service is mostly parsing?
